# G6 Hitter Squashing V.3 🎾✨🦄

## Overview 🌟

Welcome to **G6 Hitter Squashing V.3**, a whimsical web-based application created with passion and a sprinkle of magic! This app allows you to simulate the squash ball's trajectory when hit with an angle of your choosing 🎯. Customize your racket velocity, ball spin, and other quirky settings ⚙️ to experiment with distances and angles. With a cute, dreamy interface that feels like a stroll through a pastel Wonderland 🌸, you can enjoy every moment of your squashing adventure. It’s like playing squash in a world of clouds and cotton candy 🌤️🍬

> **Disclaimer:** This project was created as part of a university assignment for the **FRA163: Science in Motion** subject. The app simulates the functionality of a squash machine designed for testing and training purposes. It’s meant to demonstrate principles of physics and motion in a playful and educational manner, showcasing our future skills and capabilities in robotics and simulation technology.
